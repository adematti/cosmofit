maximize:
interval:
  # Confidence level for the confidence interval.
  # If not set or None, a standard 68.3 % confidence interval is produced.
  # If 0 < cl < 1, the value is interpreted as the confidence level (a probability).
  # If cl >= 1, it is interpreted as number of standard deviations. For example, cl = 3 produces a 3 sigma interval.
  # cl: None
profile:
  # Number of scanning points. Ignored if grid is set.
  # size: 30
  # If bound is tuple, (left, right) scanning bound. If bound is a number, it specifies an interval of N sigmas
  # symmetrically around the minimum. Ignored if grid is set.
  # bound: 2
  # Parameter values on which to compute the profile. If grid is set, size and bound are ignored.
  # grid: None
contour:
  # Confidence level for the confidence interval.
  # If not set or None, a standard 68.3 % confidence interval is produced.
  # If 0 < cl < 1, the value is interpreted as the confidence level (a probability).
  # If cl >= 1, it is interpreted as number of standard deviations. For example, cl = 3 produces a 3 sigma interval.
  # cl: None
  # Number of points on the contour to find. Increasing this makes the contour smoother, but requires more computation time.
  # size: 100
  # Number of interpolated points on the contour. If you set this to a value larger than size,
  # cubic spline interpolation is used to generate a smoother curve and the interpolated coordinates are returned.
  # Values smaller than size are ignored. Good results can be obtained with size=20, interpolated=200.
  # interpolated: 0

  long_description: Designed for solving bound-constrained general objective minimization, without requiring derivatives of the objective.

maximize:
  # The number of interpolation points to use; default is 2 * ndim + 1.
  # Py-BOBYQA requires ndim + 1 <= npt <= (ndim + 1)(ndim + 2)/2. Larger values are particularly useful for noisy problems.
  # npt: None
  # The initial value of the trust region radius default is 0.1 max(|x_0|_{\infty}, 1)`.
  # rhobeg: None
  # Minimum allowed value of trust region radius, which determines when a successful termination occurs.
  # rhoend: 1e-8
  # A flag to indicate whether to search for a global minimum, rather than a local minimum.
  # This is used to set some sensible default parameters, all of which can be overridden by the values provided in user_params.
  # If True, both upper and lower bounds must be set. Note that Py-BOBYQA only implements a heuristic method,
  # so there are no guarantees it will find a global minimum. However, by using this flag,
  # it is more likely to escape local minima if there are better values nearby.
  # The method used is a multiple restart mechanism, where we repeatedly re-initialize Py-BOBYQA from the best point found so far,
  # but where we use a larger trust reigon radius each time (note: this is different to more common multi-start approach to global optimization).
  # seek_global_minimum: False

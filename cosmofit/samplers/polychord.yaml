init:
  # Parameter blocks are groups of parameters which are updated alltogether with a frequency proportional to oversample_factor
  # Typically, parameter blocks are chosen such that parameters in a given block require the same evaluation time of the likelihood when updated
  # By default these blocks are defined at runtime, based on (measured) speeds and oversample_power (below), but can be specified there in the format
  # - [[param1, param2], oversample_factor1]
  # - [[param3, param4], oversample_factor2]
  blocks:
  # Oversample factors are speed^oversample_power
  oversample_power: 0.4
  # Number of live points. Increasing nlive increases the accuracy of posteriors and evidences,
  # and proportionally increases runtime ~ O(nlive).
  nlive: '25 * ndim'
  # The number of prior samples to draw before starting compression.
  nprior: '10*nlive'
  # The number of failed spawns before stopping nested sampling.
  nfail: '1*nlive'
  # The number of slice slice-sampling steps to generate a new point.
  # Increasing nrepeats increases the reliability of the algorithm.
  # Typically:
  # * for reliable evidences need num_repeats ~ O(5*nDims).
  # * for reliable posteriors need num_repeats ~ O(nDims)
  nrepeats: '2*ndim'
  # Variable number of live points option. This dictionary is a mapping
  # between loglike contours and nlive.
  # You should still set nlive to be a sensible number, as this indicates
  # how often to update the clustering, and to define the default value.
  nlives: {}
  # Whether or not to explore multi-modality on the posterior
  do_clustering: True
  # Increase the number of posterior samples produced. This can be set
  # arbitrarily high, but you won't be able to boost by more than nrepeats
  # Warning: in high dimensions PolyChord produces _a lot_ of posterior
  # samples. You probably don't need to change this
  boost_posterior: 0.
  # Parallelise with synchronous workers, rather than asynchronous ones.
  # This can be set to False if the likelihood speed is known to be
  # approximately constant across the parameter space. Synchronous
  # parallelisation is less effective than asynchronous by a factor ~O(1)
  # for large parallelisation.
  synchronous: True

run:
  # How often to update the files and do clustering
  compression_factor: e'np.exp(-1)'
  check:
    # Nested sampling terminates when the evidence contained in the live points is precision_criterion fraction of the total evidence.
    precision_criterion: 0.001

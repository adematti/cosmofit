init:
  # Number of walkers, defaults to 2 * max((int(2.5 * ndim) + 1) // 2, 2)
  # Can be given in dimension units, e.g. 3 * ndim
  nwalkers: None
  # If True (default is False) then no expansions are performed after the tuning phase.
  # This can significantly reduce the number of log likelihood evaluations but works best in target distributions that are apprroximately Gaussian.

run:
  # Thin samples by this factor
